# adv-fs-fizzbuzz

Hereâ€™s how the program goes:

The program prints 1 to 100.
Each number that is evenly divisible by 3, instead of writing the number, write fizz.
If the number is evenly divisible by 5, instead of writing the number, write buzz.
If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, instead of writing the number or fizz or buzz, write fizzbuzz.
To help us out with readability, write out each number or word on its own line.

An additional perk to this exercise is it allows interviewing engineers to ask you why you wrote the code the way you did. Be prepared to offer explanations.
